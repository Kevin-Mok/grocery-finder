Administrator Instructions:

  An administrator has access to all functionalities that are available to standard users. As such, accessing these common
 functionalities can be achieved by adhering to the standard user's instructions in the section above.
 
  In addiition to the aforementioned functionalities, users with administrative privileges will also have exclusive access to a 'Manage Users' webpage. It is from this specific webpage that an administrator will be able to access administrative processes.
  
                              > How to access the 'Manage Users' webpage from index.html <
             
  1.  Hover over the profile icon located on the left side of the navigation bar to open a dropdown menu
  2.  Click the 'Login' option
  3.  Sign in with the following credentials:
          username:admin      
          password:admin
  4.  Open the same dropdown menu from step 1, and click the 'Manage Users' option. This will open the 'Manage Users' webpage.
  
                                      > Anatomy of the 'Manage Users' webpage <
                                      
  There are two main frames on this webpage. The leftmost frame lists out all registered users, and the administrator will be able
  to select a specific user in order to view/modify that user's account details. If there are a lot of users, the administrator 
  can filter out users via the provided search bar. The rightmost frame displays the selected user's account details. If the
  selected user DOES NOT have administrative privileges, all of the user's account details will be visible (and modifiable) to the
  administrator. If the selected user DOES have administrative privileges, then selected user's password will be censored, and
  none of their account details can be modified by the administrator.
  
  If the administrator wishes to return to the index page, there is a button that is left of the user listing frame that leads to
  the index page.
