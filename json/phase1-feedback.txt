Hi team 44,

Your project is overall well done and a good demonstration of your project idea. However, I found the UI to be very confusing and somewhat buggy. My overall recommendation is to make a separate page for each major function of the application.

Here is some more specific feedback on items that contributed to your grades for Layout and Usability:

  - The navigation bar is full of overloaded user interactions. The icons are there on every page but they do different things depending on what page you're on. This is hard for a user to learn and leads to unintuitive behaviour on the application. For example, if you are looking at the list of grocery stores, why is there a floppy disk icon that allows you to save your current cart? Or when you are looking at grocery stores, what does the "All" button do?

  - The "All" button is actually redundant because there is an "All" option in the "Produce" dropdown.

  - Using icons exclusively can also be very confusing to a user. As someone who has never used your app, how am I supposed to know what the calculator button supposed to do?

  - UI hover states should not be the same as active states. This is confusing for the adding items user interaction: since the mouse hover state is identical to the "checked" state, you don't know if clicking it did anything unless you mouse away. This becomes a more serious problem in a real application when clicking a button requires a server call that may fail.

  - If you go to the page with your current cart or the produce listing, then type something in the search bar, it goes to the grocery store list page. Why?

  - There is no logout button. When the user is logged in there should be a logout button and no "sign up" button.

A general comment: more effort went into your admin page than required. Admin pages only need to be able to modify/delete objects on the website, they don't need to look nice and they don't need to duplicate functionality for regular users. You can simplify the admin page a lot for your next phase -- even a HTML table with no CSS would be fine.
